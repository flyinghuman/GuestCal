# GuestCal
Fork of [GuestCal](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guestcal/) to develop php7 support.

GuestCal is an occupancy calendar written in PHP. It's designed to be integrated in websites for holiday apartments, but can be used for many other things.

The official development of GuestCal has been discontinued at version 2.1.4. 

You can find the release with php70-support [here](https://github.com/geimist/GuestCal/releases/tag/2.1.2_php70)
